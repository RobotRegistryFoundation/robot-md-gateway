# Changelog

## v0.3.0a1 — 2026-05-03

### Renamed

- **Package + GitHub repo: `robot-md-dispatcher` → `robot-md-gateway`.** Old PyPI name republished as a tombstone (v0.2.1) that depends on this package. Old GitHub URL redirects.
- **Module: `robot_md_dispatcher` → `robot_md_gateway`.** Backward-compat shim ships at the old import path with a `DeprecationWarning`. Shim removed in v0.5.0.
- **CLI: `robot-md-gateway`** is the new command. The old `robot-md-dispatcher` command keeps working with a deprecation banner; removed in v0.5.0.

### Scope-shifted

- **Default mode is now receive-only RCAN envelope enforcement.** The gateway accepts signed INVOKE envelopes, verifies them, and dispatches to drivers. The previous v0.2.x planner-launcher mode is preserved behind `--legacy-byok-launcher` for backward compat — deprecation-warned, removed in v0.4.0.
- **Manifest provenance verification added.** Every action's target ROBOT.md is checked for a valid signature against an RRF-registered key (cert property MF-001 / MF-002).
- **Direct device-node bypass denial added.** udev policy generator + service-account isolation enforce the gateway as the exclusive `/dev/tty*` owner (cert property GW-001).

### Forbidden-phrase lint

- The previous v0.2.x framing is now blocked by the ecosystem-wide forbidden-phrase lint (Plan 2). The new README ships into already-honest copy.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-24

### Added
- New `robot-md-dispatcher init` subcommand that scaffolds `bearers.yaml`, `.env`, and a `dispatch-test.sh` smoke-test script for a robot whose `ROBOT.md` is already in place. Has a guided mode (explains each knob) and a `--yes` one-shot mode (all defaults).
- `--force` flag to regenerate files (invalidates old tokens).
- `--no-token-stdout` flag that suppresses the "print token once" step — used by the `/enable-dispatch` Claude Code slash command in `robot-md-mcp` so fresh secrets never enter agent context.
- Hard-fail preconditions: `ROBOT.md` must exist and pass `robot_md.validate`; `robot-md-mcp` must be on PATH.

### Changed
- `robot-md>=1.1` is now a runtime dependency (used for ROBOT.md parse + validate via Python API instead of subprocessing the CLI). This pulls in `robot-md`'s transitive deps (numpy, jinja2, jsonschema, mcp, rich, ruamel-yaml, typer, websockets, rcan[pq,crypto]) — install footprint grows accordingly; users on minimal images should be aware.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-24

Initial scaffold. FastAPI `/dispatch` endpoint, tier-based gating, bearer auth, systemd install script, BYOK billing pattern.
